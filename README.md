## Chapter 3 Overview
This section examines the influence of different surface texture depths on contact area temperature rise. It also investigates the impact of various texture types and slip ratios on temperature distribution.

## Data and Results
- **Surface Texture Depths**: Results indicate a general trend of temperature rise with increasing texture depth, attributed to oil film rupture.
- **Texture Types**: Cross-shaped grooves demonstrate lower temperatures due to their ability to store lubricating oil effectively.
- **Slip Ratios**: Higher slip ratios lead to increased temperature in contact areas, emphasizing the importance of controlling slip for temperature management.

## Conclusion
The analysis highlights the importance of surface texture design and slip control in optimizing lubrication effectiveness and managing temperature rise in rolling bearings. Practical recommendations include avoiding excessive texture depths and controlling slip ratios to prevent surface failure.
